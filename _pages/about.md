I am a statistical physicist with a strong interest in non-equilibrium systems relating to evolution. My current research focusses on utilising techniques from non-equilibrium statistical physics to investigate problems concerning the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biological systems.

I am primarily interested in understanding how evolution is impacted by external influences, relevant to microbial communities where external influences are something one may be able to control. This has implications for the development of antimicrobial resistance and cancer. 

My interests are not limited solely to biological systems (though these are incredibly interesting!), but also include social dynamics and the evolution of AI through competitive and coevolutionary processes, though I am yet to foray into these topics personally.

Here you will find everything to do with my publications, talks, teaching, and anything else I think is worthwhile having on here.

If you would like to get in contact with me, please do so on my email: [mmmwa@leeds.ac.uk](mailto:mmmwa@leeds.ac.uk).

You can also find me on Bluesky: [masker.science](https://bsky.app/profile/masker.science)

I currently maintain the website for the Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics of Fluctuating Populations research group, which can be found here: [eedfp.com](https://eedfp.com).
